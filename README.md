Testing project

To start the project in your browser


npm install lite-server

lite-server


This is just a prototype, so I have not added any scafolding, minification etc.
My focus was just to complete the basic requirements of the application and make it running.
I kept it as simple as I could.


Things that are in loop ( Can be done if require )

Scafolding using webpack, assests optimization
Convert polling logic into push logic - Means convert it into socket application.
Can use firebase push notification. Or socket.io.
Use redis to store unread message.
Unit testing - Jasmine
End To End testing using protractorjs, jasmine
Performance testing using Artillery
